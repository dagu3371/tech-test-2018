Pact coffee delivers freshly roasted coffee by post.

Context
---
As a business we acquire new customers from marketing channels,
We incentivise a new customer's first bag of coffee because we know our coffee is incredible
We have a range of incentives to entice new customers

- Discount: A percentage off
- Credit: A monetry value off

*This is a high level overview to set the context for this test*

Your task
----
Fix and refactor the codebase. Make the specs green and ensure that it's working as expected.
Use the integration spec to guide you through.

The test itself is pretty straight forward but your solution will require you to make design and product decisions.

Getting started
----
- Clone the repository
- change to the project directory
- run `bundle install`
- run `rspec` to see the failing specs you need to make pass.


We expect
----
- clean code
- a commit history (so we can understand your thought process)
- green specs

If you have some spare time, describe and add a new voucher of your choice.

We look forward to your pull request.

Good Luck!
